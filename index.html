    <h1> From Zero to Code Hero: My Journey into Web Development</h1>

    <p>Just a few weeks ago, I didn’t know how to write a single line of code. I had no idea what <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> meant or how websites were even built. Today, I’m proud to say I’m confident using <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>.</p>

    <h2> Day 1: Clueless but Curious</h2>
    <p>My journey started with total confusion. I opened VS Code for the first time and stared at a blank screen, not knowing what to type. I kept Googling terms like “what is HTML?” and “how do websites work?”</p>

    <h2>Learning HTML</h2>
    <p>HTML was the first language I learned. It was like learning the skeleton of a website. I started creating basic pages with headings, paragraphs, and links. Seeing my content appear in the browser felt like magic.</p>

    <h2> Adding Style with CSS</h2>
    <p>Once I understood structure, I wanted to make it look better. That’s where CSS came in. I learned how to style pages, center content, change colors, and make things responsive. Suddenly, websites started to look like real websites.</p>

    <h2> Powering It Up with JavaScript</h2>
    <p>Then came JavaScript — the real game-changer. It was hard at first, but I kept at it. I learned how to use <code>addEventListener</code>, update the DOM, fetch data, and build full projects like my own <strong>Virtual Art Gallery</strong>.</p>

    <h2> What I’ve Built So Far</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A multi-page HTML site</li>
      <li>Styled blog with external CSS</li>
      <li>Interactive art gallery app using fetch and DOM manipulation</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> What’s Next?</h2>
    <p>This is just the beginning. I plan to keep learning more JavaScript, dive into frameworks like React, and keep building cool things. If you’re just starting, trust me — you’ll get it. One line at a time.</p>
